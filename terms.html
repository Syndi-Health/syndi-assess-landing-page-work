      <br><br>
      It is entirely up to you, but provide you with the option to answer SMS check-ups and update your dashboard with your latest mental wellbeing self-assessment scores. 
      <br><br>
      If you choose not to subscribe to SMS check-ups, then you can keep using our App but your dashboard will not update automatically. 
      <br><br>
      If you choose to subscribe, then we will also offer you additional services, including automated check-ups and monitoring of your use of the App which, in the circumstances selected by you, will trigger the curation of recommended resources. 
      <br><br>
      Those questionnaires and SMS messages will also be automated and might, for example, be an additional page or text in some circumstances to provide you with phone numbers and website links to additional mental wellbeing support services. We do not give advice and you should always seek the help of a medical professional where necessary.
